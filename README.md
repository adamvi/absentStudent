# Overview

The **absentStudent** [GitHub](www.github.com) repository contains an
[R](https://cran.r-project.org/) package developed to analyze and
address missing student records in longitudinal data sets. Specifically, this
package has been developed for use along side with the [SGP](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment/SGP)
package to analyze the impact of missing (absent) data in the calculation of
student growth percentiles (SGPs).
